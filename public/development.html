        <div class="pbox">
          <p class="blue center"> For this project, I designed a React App website to display my art
            portfolio.
            My purpose for pursuing this project was inspired by the website I already have for my art portfolio;
            it is a google site that does little beyond displaying each piece and its name and medium: <br><br>

          I figured that potential users may want to know more about my art, such as whether it has won awards,
          when it was created, and how much time it took. Hence, for my development project, I created a website that
          allows you to filter amd sort my art pieces along relevant criteria, as well as included an aggregator that
          allows the user to total up how much time it took for me to complete certain pieces.

      <h2>Visual Design Choices</h2>
      <div class="flex-column">
        <p class="blue center pbox">I designed the website to have a modern-looking navbar at the very top that contains
          drop down menus for each filtering and sort method.
          The image of every piece is displayed on the left while a description of its attributes is on the right to
          help
          keep everything organized. When you add a piece to the aggregator, mini versions of the images will appear at
          the top and bottom of the screen
          for easy viewing no matter what half of the website you are on. Please have a look ðŸ¤—!
