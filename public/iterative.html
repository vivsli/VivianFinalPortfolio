  <br>
  <p class="pbox words">
    As a group project for my UI/UX class, my groupmates and I selected a start-up and designed a website for the
    startup based solely on the ideas that the startup was built upon. We did not look at any media that the company has
    actually published (ie. websites, social media posts)
  </p>

  <div class="pbox spacing">
    <h2> Here are the steps we took to accomplish this:</h2>
    <ol class="white">
      <li><a href="#step1" class="words">We considered the primary goals of our start up and brainstormed and sketched
          out different possible layouts and design
          choices accordingly</a></li>
      <li><a href="#step2" class="words">We consolidated all our sketches into one detailed wireframe using Figma</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="#step3" class="words">Using our finalized wireframe as a template, we created hi-fi prototype of our
          imagined website based on the percieved goals of the startup</a></li>
      <li><a href="#step4" class="words">We had our interactive hi-fi prototype tested: first by other fellow peers
          working on
          similar projects </a></li>
      <li><a href="#step5" class="words">Based on the feedback from our peers, we redesigned our interactive mockup and
          then submitted it to UserTesting.com for further testing.</a></li>
      <li><a href="#step6" class="words">Using all our feedback, we reflected on our final product and the lessons we
          learned thorugh the process!</a></li>

  <h2 class="text-center spacing">Sketching & Wireframing</h2>
  <div class="flex-column" id="step1">
    <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Pre-Design Thinking</h4>
    <p class="pbox words">
      The start-up that we chose was Quell, a tech company hoping to claim their
      place as pioneers in the immersive fitness gaming market. The Quell System uses
      haptic resistance bands that connect to an external console to enable players to get
      fit while punching their way through the enemies in a virtual adventure world
    </p>
    <p class="pbox words">
      We designed a desktop website that serves as a dual platform for users to both
      find out more about The Quell and pre-order their very own Quell System so they can
      play as soon as it is released.
    </p>
    <p class="pbox words">
      The users that we are likely to recieve are gaming geeks and fitness freaks alike, as these are the types of
      people that the Quell is most likely to attract.
    </p>

    <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Sketching</h4>
    <p class="pbox words">
      As a group, we came up with 4 diverse sketches of possible designs for our website that each uniquely informed
      our final product. Our sketches are depicted below:

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Design Choices</h4>
  <div class="row justify-content-center words" id="step3">
    <p class="pbox words">When designing our webpage, there were a couple of design choices we kept in mind:</p>

    <ul class="list-group w-50">
      <li class="list-group-item">It should appeal to gamers, so a dark background with saturated colors should be used.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">The webpage should seem modern and exciting, so we went with a sideways navbar</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">There should be distinct separation of pages so users can easily find different
        sections to view.</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Information should be long, but clear. Users should be given as much information as
        possible before making an expensive purchase</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Images should accompany text to give the user a better idea of the information given.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p class="mt-5 mb-5 pbox words">And with those details in mind, we set off to create our first iteration of the hi-fi
    prototype!

  <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">First Iteration</h4>

  </div>

  <p class="mt-3 mb-5 pbox words">We originally thought that we had a pretty strong first iteration. However, after
    going
    through
    the critique, we realized
    that we needed to keep specific ideas in mind, specifically information architecture. Nobody's perfect, and so the
    iterative design process and testing is essential
    for creating clearer webpages.
