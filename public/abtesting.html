  <h1 class="title">Knowing your ABC's</h1>
  <h2 class="words"> For this project, I made two different changes to one website
    and determined which change better fulfilled the given criteria. Here are the
    steps I took to accomplish this:
  </h2>
  <div class="boxed">
    <ol>
      <li>I made two changes to the same website, thus creating two versions (A and B) and deployed the website
        in such a way that each version of the website would each be shone to 50% of users, and deployed the
        website to Heroku</li>
      <li>I made predictions on how each of my website variations would perform under two criteria:
        Time to Completion and Return Rate</li>
      <li>I coded the statistical tests I would be using in Python</li>
      <li>I extracted user data from my deployed websites and cleaned the data via Microsoft Excel</li>
      <li>I ran my data logs through my python code to obtain the results of my t-test and chi-squared comparisons</li>

    <div class="boxed">
      <h2 class="words">The main difference between versions A and B is the pricing. Popular opinion
        has it that having a price end in ".99" gives the illusion that an item is cheaper
        so more people are likely to buy it.
        To test whether this fact is true, I made the pricing of one website whole numbers (ie. $10)
        and the pricing of another one cent less than it's counterpart (ie. $9.99)

    <h1 class="title">Making Hypotheses</h1>
    <h2 class="words">I made two hypotheses; one for each criteria: Time to Completion and Return Rate.</h4>
      <div class="words boxed">
        <h3 class="words">Time to Completion: the time it takes to complete the desired task (in this case, order cacti)
        </h3>
        <h3 class="words">Return Rate: the number of times a user returned to the page</h3>
      </div>
      <h4 class="words">Time to Completion Hypothesis: Since the task was to put $150 worth of cacti into the cart,
        I operated under the assumption that most users (aka our fellow classmates) would spam-click the
        first button they saw. Setting the price of the first button to $10 means that the user would only
        need to click the "Add to Cart" button 10 times. However, setting the price to $9.99 means that the
        user would need to click the button 11 times. I hypothesize that this slight difference will result in
        my "Whole Number Price Point" version to have a shorter Time to Completion
      </h4>
      <h4 class="words">Return Rate Hypothesis: Since return rate usually manifests itself as the user viewing the
        cart and then returning to the main shopping screen, my prediction for return rate is based on the users
        that I think are more likley to view the cart. Since decimal price points make it harder to calculate whether
        a user has hit their $150 quota, I hypothesize that Decimal Price Point version users are more likely
        to check the cart to view their price and return back to the home screen, thus having a higher rate
        of return </h4>

      <div class="flex-column boxed">
        <h2 class="words">In order to collect data, I deployed my website to Heroku and allowed users to access my

      <h1 class="title">Takeaways</h1>
      <ul class="words boxed">
        <li>I think that my results would have been more compelling had I had a larger sample size. It's hard to
          say whether my results are accurate or if a Type I or Type II error occurred because I have so little power
          due to small sample size.
        </li>
        <li>Assuming that my results are valid, my experiments demonstrate that not all visible differences actually
          ellicit
          different behaviors in users.</li>
