This website contains six components. Each component is described 
(in hierarchal order) below:

1. App
- This is the main file that contains all the information associated with each art piece "card." It renders 
the component FilteredList

2. FilteredList
- this component contains the primary renderer that returns the majority of what you see on screen:
the navbar, all the pieces as created by the DisplayList component, the list of pieces in the aggregator (TimeCountDisplay)
as well as the sum total calculated by the aggregator (TimeCount). The DisplayList component is rendered 
here after all the filter and sort methods that are in FilteredList are applied. FilteredList also
contains a state for each filter/sort criterion that updates everymtime a filter/sort criterion is selected in the 
navbar dropdown menu. There is also a "total" state for the aggregator that totals the amount of time spent
on the pieces that are selected (the aggregator will be described in greater depth below.)

3. DisplayList
- this component renders every "piece-card" after taking in the dictionary containing all vital information from App.js 
by utilizing the map function.

THE AGGREGATOR COMPONENTS
the components described below are necessitated by the aggregator:

The aggregator aggregates the total amount of time spent on every piece that is selected to be in the aggregator.

4.TimeAdder
- This component renders a button that can be pressed to add or remove its respective piece from the aggregator. It contains the state isPressed 
that stores whether or not the button has been pressed. This state is updated every time the user clicks on the button. The time value 
associated with each TimeAdder button is passed down from DisplayList and passed to the TimeCount.

5. TimeCount
- This component renders the total amount of time that has been added to the aggregator. The time values are passed to TimeCount from the 
TimeAdder components when they are pressed.

6.TimeCountDisplay
- This component displays a list of the mini versions of the images of the pieces that are selected to be in the aggregator 
just so that the reader can keep track of what they have added. A list of the image sources is passed to this component from
FilteredList, which stores this list in the state, timeCountList. This component is called twice by FilteredList; once before DisplayList
and once after, just so the user can view whats in the aggregator by scrolling both up or down.
